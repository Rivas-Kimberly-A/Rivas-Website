    <h1>No Time to Pray</h1><br><br>
    <h2>By K. J. Koshy</h2><br>
    <div class="poem">
        <p>I knelt to pray but not for long,<br>
        I had too much to do.<br>
        I had to hurry and get to work<br>
        For bills would soon be due.</p>

        <p>So I knelt and said a hurried prayer,<br>
        And jumped up off my knees.<br>
        My Christian duty was now done<br>
        My soul could rest at ease.</p>

        <p>All day long I had no time<br>
        To spread a word of cheer.<br>
        No time to speak of Christ to friends,<br>
        They'd laugh at me I'd fear.</p>

        <p>No time, no time, too much to do,<br>
        That was my constant cry,<br>
        No time to give to souls in need<br>
        But at last the time, the time to die.</p>

        <p>I went before the Lord,<br>
        I came, I stood with downcast eyes.<br>
        For in his hands God held a book;<br>
        It was the book of life.</p>

        <p>God looked into his book and said<br>
        "Your name I cannot find.<br>
        I once was going to write it down...<br>
        But never found the time."</p>
